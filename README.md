Fluxus Executor Mobile (IOS/Android) no key latest updated version -  This allows you to consume silver from taxation (you can collect silver from your city every day by clicking on a button that looks like a building) for heroes, usually low-level heroes, but you can occasionally get Epics and Rares. This is the best money transfer in the game, because even if it may give you unwanted heroes, it is quite cheap, and unwanted heroes can be converted into SP, skill points. SP can be used to enhance skills, and repeated or unwanted heroes can be used to increase the highest level of skills. Keep scrolling through this additional check. If you are deceived by heroes who have reached their limit, you can use the skill inheritance function to get rid of them, and you will be able to apply their hero specific skills to other heroes with open skill slots. Please note that each hero can only complete once, so any further repetitions should be melted for SP or reserved for events that require you. Fluxus executor download version 25.09.12
